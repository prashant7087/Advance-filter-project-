This AI Fitter tool uses Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to perform facial analysis for optical measurements. It processes a user's video to detect facial landmarks, creates a real-world scale from a known glasses frame width, and accurately calculates the Pupillary Distance (PD) and other key metrics needed for fitting progressive lenses
